# IPFS W3Auth Pinning Service

Decentralized IPFS remote pinning service with [Crust Network](https://crust.network).

## [‚ùì About IPFS W3Auth Pinning Service](https://wiki.crust.network/docs/en/buildIPFSW3AuthPin)

## ‚ú® Usage

The IPFS W3Auth Pinning Service(aka. W3Auth PS) is compatible with standard IPFS remote pinning service. You can refer [IPFS Docs](https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/work-with-pinning-services/#use-an-existing-pinning-service) to learn how to use remote pin.

As for the **Access Token** of W3Auth PS, you can easily get it with several web3 ways.

```shell
Authorization: Bear <base64(ChainType-PubKey:SignedMsg)>
```

Let's take `ipfs cli` as an example

```shell
ipfs pin remote service add crustpinner http://localhost:3000/psa base64(ChainType-PubKey:SignedMsg)
```

### Get ChainType

`ChainType` now can be:

1. `sub`(or `substrate`)
2. `eth`(or `ethereum`)
3. `sol`(or `solana`)
4. `pol` (or `polygon`)
5. `nea` (or `near`)
6. `ava`(or `avalanche`)

And you can get `PubKey` and `SignedMsg` by using the following web3-ways:

### Get Pubkey and SignedMsg

### 1. With Substrate

#### Get `PubKey`

`PubKey` is just the substrate address, like `5Chu5r5GA41xFgMXLQd6CDjz1ABGEGVGS276xjv93ApY6vD7`

All substrate-based chains are adapted:

`PubKey` is just the polygon address(42-characters) start with `0x`. It's compatiable with the ethereum.

#### Get SignedMsg

Just sign the `PubKey` with your polygon private key to get the `SignedMsg`

### 6. With Near

You can sign the `PubKey` with one of your near private key associated with your account to get the `SignedMsg`

## üöÄ Deploy

### 1. Start MySQL

W3Auth PS uses MySQL as its state database, you can just use [docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql) to start and config the db service.

### 2. Init State DB

Please execute the `sql script` under `./sql` folder to create database and state tables.

### 3. Config

#### 3.1 Config pinning service

Please create an `.env` file baseon `.env-example`, each config item means:

```js
NODE_ENV // `production` or `dev`
MYSQL_HOST // optional, default is `localhost`
MYSQL_PORT // optional, default is `3306`
MYSQL_DB // optional, default is `pinning_service` created by ./sql/V1_CREATE_DATABASE.sql
MYSQL_USER // optional, default is `root`
MYSQL_PASSWORD // optional, default is `root`
MYSQL_POOL_MAX // optional, default is `10`
MYSQL_POOL_MIN // optional, default is `0`
MYSQL_POOL_IDLE // optional, default is `30,000`
MYSQL_POOL_ACQUIRE // optional, default is `30,000`
CRUST_SEED // required, the pinning pool private seeds
WS_ENDPOINT // optional, crust chain websocket address, default is `wss://rpc-crust-mainnet.decoo.io`
DEFAULT_FILE_SIZE // optional, ordering file size, default is 2GB
CRUST_TIPS // optional, ordering tips, default is 0.00005 CRUs
VALID_FILE_REPLICAS // optional, the successfully pinning replica count, default is 3
```

#### 3.2 Config supported chains

W3Auth PS allows nodes config supported chains with sql script, default supported chain is `substrate`, you can config different `chain_name` with corresponding `chain_type`(auth way):

`chain_type`

- `0`: Support all substrate-based chains authentication
- `1`: Support all eth-compatible chains authentication, like `ethereum`/`polygon`/`bsc`/...
- `2`: Support solana authentication

And you can run the following sql to add/delete supported chains:

- Add

```sql
INSERT INTO `pinning_service`.`chain` (`chain_name`, `chain_type`) VALUES ('eth', 1);
```

- Delete

```sql
DELETE FROM `pinning_service`.`chain` WHERE `chain_name`='eth';
```

### 4. Start pinning service

- Run with docker

    Just run with the compose file in this repo

    ```shell
    docker-compose up -d order-service
    ```

- Run with node native

    ```shell
    # 1. Clone repo
    git clone https://github.com/crustio/ipfs-w3auth-pinning-service.git
    # 2. Install and build
    yarn && yarn build
    # 3. Run
    yarn start
    ```

Then, you can just config the standard IPFS remote pinning service with `http://localhost:3000/psa`!
